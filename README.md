[@rethinlhealth/hl7v2](.) is a tool that transforms HL7v2 messages with plugins using the [`unified`][github-unified] framework. These plugins can inspect, transform, and validate the HL7v2 messages. You can use `@rethinkhealth/hl7v2` on the server, the client, deno, etc.

## Intro

`@rethinlhealth/hl7v2` is an ecosystem of plugins that work with HL7v2 as structured data, specifically ASTs (abstract syntax trees). ASTs make it easy for programs to deal with HL7v2. We call those programs plugins. Plugins inspect and change trees. You can use the many existing plugins or you can make your own.

The [`unified`][github-unified] framework is a powerful and proven tool for building parsers, transformers, and compilers for structured text formats. It is widely used in the JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystem for processing formats like Markdown, HTML, and more. HL7v2 messages, while unique to healthcare, share many characteristics with these formats: they are line-oriented, hierarchical, and benefit from being represented as abstract syntax trees (ASTs).

By leveraging `unified` for HL7v2 parsing, we gain:

- **Structured Parsing:** HL7v2 messages are notoriously difficult to work with as plain text. Parsing them into ASTs makes it much easier to analyze, transform, and validate messages programmatically.
- **Consistency:** `unified` provides a consistent interface for parsing, transforming, and serializing data, making it easier for developers to work with HL7v2 alongside other formats.
- **Interoperability:** The `unified` ecosystem is mature and well-documented, allowing HL7v2 tools to interoperate with a wide range of existing plugins and utilities.

## Install

This package is [ESM only](https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/a39789f98801d908bbc7ff3ecc99d99c). In Node.js (version 16+), install with [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v11/commands/npm-install):

```bash
npm install @rethinkhealth/hl7v2
```

## Use

```typescript
import { parseHL7v2 } from '@rethinkhealth/hl7v2';

const hl7v2 = `MSH|^~\\&|SendingApp|SendingFac|ReceivingApp|ReceivingFac|202406101200||ADT^A01|123456|P|2.5
PID|1||123456^^^Hospital^MR||Doe^John^^^^^L||19800101|M|||123 Main St^^Metropolis^NY^10001||555-1234`;

const tree = parseHL7v2.parse(hl7v2);

console.error(reporter(file))
console.log(String(file)));
```

## Packages

The `@rethinkhealth/hl7v2` ecosystem is organized as a set of modular packages, each focused on a specific aspect of HL7v2 message processing. These packages are designed to work together or independently, depending on your needs.

### Core Packages

- **[@rethinkhealth/hl7v2][github-hl7v2-core]**: main entry point for HL7v2 message parsing, transformation, and validation. It provides a unified interface for working with HL7v2 messages as ASTs.

- **[@rethinkhealth/hl7v2-parser][github-hl7v2-parser]**: a `unified`-compatible parser that converts HL7v2 message text into a structured AST. It handles delimiter detection, segment/field/component parsing, and position tracking. This package is used internally by `@rethinkhealth/hl7v2`, but can be used standalone for custom workflows.

- **[@rethinkhealth/hl7v2-jsonify][github-hl7v2-jsonify]**: serializes HL7v2 ASTs to JSON. This is useful for integrating HL7v2 data with modern web APIs and applications.

- **[@rethinkhealth/hl7v2-ast][github-hl7v2-ast]**: defines the TypeScript types and interfaces for the HL7v2 AST structure. Ensures type safety and consistency across all packages in the ecosystem.

- **[@rethinkhealth/hl7v2-cli][github-hl7v2-cli]**: a command-line tool for parsing, validating, and transforming HL7v2 messages. Useful for quick inspection, conversion, and automation in CI/CD pipelines.

### Plugins

Plugins are composable functions that extend or modify the behavior of the HL7v2 processor. Plugins can add support for new syntaxes, transform the abstract syntax tree (AST), or integrate with external tools.

- **[@rethinkhealth/hl7v2-decode-escapes][github-hl7v2-decode-escapes]**: decodes HL7v2 escape sequences (e.g., `\F\`, `\S\`, `\T\`, etc.) into their literal values, ensuring message content is interpreted correctly.

- **[@rethinkhealth/hl7v2-to-hl7v2][github-hl7v2-to-hl7v2]**: converts HL7v2 AST nodes back to HL7v2 message text. Supports serializing any node type (Root, Segment, Field, etc.) and preserves delimiters. Useful for round-tripping, message editing, or custom serialization workflows.


### Linting

The `@rethinlhealth/hl7v2` ecosystem includes custom linting rules to help ensure message quality, conformance, and best practices. These lint rules are designed to catch common mistakes and enforce consistency in HL7v2 messages. Each rule is implemented as a `unified` plugin and can be used independently or in combination.

#### Lint Preset(s)

The recommended way to enable HL7v2 linting is to use the official preset:

- **[@rethinkhealth/hl7v2-preset-lint-recommended][github-hl7v2-preset-lint-recommended]**  
  This preset bundles all core HL7v2 lint rules, providing a comprehensive set of checks for message quality, conformance, and best practices.  
  By using the preset, you ensure your messages are validated against all supported rules with sensible defaults, and you can customize or extend the configuration as needed.

#### Lint Rules

The rules that are maintained in this repo:

- **[@rethinkhealth/hl7v2-lint-required-message-header][github-hl7v2-lint-required-message-header]**  
  Ensures that every HL7v2 message includes a required message header segment (such as `MSH`). This rule helps catch incomplete or malformed messages that are missing the standard header, which is essential for correct parsing and routing.

- **[@rethinkhealth/hl7v2-lint-max-message-size][github-hl7v2-lint-max-message-size]**  
  Reports when an HL7v2 message exceeds a configurable maximum size (in bytes or number of segments). Helps prevent oversized messages that may be rejected by downstream systems.

- **[@rethinkhealth/hl7v2-lint-no-trailing-empty-field][github-hl7v2-lint-no-trailing-empty-field]**  
  Detects and warns about empty fields at the end of a segment, which can cause ambiguity or interoperability issues in HL7v2 messages. This helps ensure that segments do not contain unnecessary trailing separators or empty fields.

- **[@rethinkhealth/hl7v2-lint-segment-header-length][github-hl7v2-lint-segment-header-length]**  
  Validates that all segment headers are exactly three characters long, as required by the HL7v2 specification. This rule helps catch typos and malformed segment identifiers.

### Utilities

Utilities are supporting packages that provide common helper functions and low-level tools used throughout the HL7v2 ecosystem. Utilities help ensure consistency, reduce duplication, and simplify maintenance across all related packages.

- **[@rethinkhealth/hl7v2-utils](./packages/hl7v2-utils)**: shared utilities for delimiter detection, normalization, and other HL7v2-specific helpers.
