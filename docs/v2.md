# V2 Review Strategy

The objective of the `v2` design would be to provide:

1. Better developer experience
2. Improved performance
3. Stronger type safety
4. Better error handling
5. More maintainable code
6. Better extensibility
7. Modern development features

## Objectives

1. **Simplified Message Structure**

- Current Implementation: The code uses a complex hierarchical structure with Groups, Segments, and Elements, which can be difficult to navigate and maintain.
- V2 Improvement: Implement a flatter, more intuitive structure that focuses on the message as a collection of segments with clear relationships. This would make the code more maintainable and easier to understand.

2. **Enhanced Type Safety**

- Current Implementation: The code uses generic types and type assertions (`as any`) in several places, which reduces type safety.
- V2 Improvement: Implement strict TypeScript types for all HL7v2 message components, including:
  - Strongly typed segment definitions
  - Type-safe field access
  - Compile-time validation of message structures
  - Better error handling with specific error types

3. **Improved Schema Validation**

- Current Implementation: Schema validation is optional and somewhat complex to implement.
- V2 Improvement:
  - Make schema validation mandatory by default
  - Provide clear validation error messages
  - Support custom validation rules
  - Add support for newer HL7v2 versions
  - Implement better schema caching and performance optimizations

4. **Better Performance**

- Current Implementation: The current implementation processes messages sequentially and has multiple passes over the data.
- V2 Improvement:
  - Implement streaming message processing
  - Add support for parallel processing of large messages
  - Optimize memory usage with better data structures
  - Add caching mechanisms for frequently accessed segments

5. **Modern API Design**

- Current Implementation: The API is somewhat verbose and requires multiple steps to process messages.
- V2 Improvement:
  - Implement a fluent API for message construction and manipulation
  - Add builder pattern for message creation
  - Provide async/await support for all operations
  - Add better support for message transformation and mapping

6. **Enhanced Error Handling**

- Current Implementation: Error handling is basic and doesn't provide detailed information about parsing issues.
- V2 Improvement:
  - Implement detailed error reporting with line numbers and context
  - Add support for error recovery and partial message processing
  - Provide better debugging tools and logging
  - Add validation error aggregation

7. **Better Documentation and Examples**

- Current Implementation: The codebase lacks comprehensive documentation and examples.
- V2 Improvement:
  - Add detailed API documentation
  - Provide more examples for common use cases
  - Add interactive documentation
  - Include performance benchmarks and best practices

8. **Testing and Quality Assurance**

- Current Implementation: Testing infrastructure exists but could be more comprehensive.
- V2 Improvement:
  - Add more unit tests
  - Implement integration tests
  - Add performance tests
  - Include fuzzing tests for robustness

9. **Extensibility**

- Current Implementation: Extending the library requires modifying core classes.
- V2 Improvement:
  - Implement a plugin system for custom segment types
  - Add support for custom validators
  - Provide hooks for message processing
  - Support custom serialization formats

10. **Modern Development Features**

- Current Implementation: Basic development setup with TypeScript.
- V2 Improvement:
  - Add support for modern bundlers
  - Implement tree-shaking
  - Add source maps for better debugging
  - Support for modern JavaScript features

Here's a proposed structure for the v2 implementation:

```typescript
// Example of improved API design
class HL7v2Message {
  // Fluent API for message construction
  static create(): MessageBuilder;
  
  // Async parsing with better error handling
  static async parse(message: string): Promise<HL7v2Message>;
  
  // Type-safe segment access
  getSegment<T extends Segment>(name: string): T;
  
  // Better validation
  validate(): ValidationResult;
  
  // Modern serialization
  toJSON(): object;
  toString(): string;
  
  // Streaming support
  static fromStream(stream: ReadableStream): AsyncIterator<HL7v2Message>;
}

// Example of improved validation
interface ValidationResult {
  isValid: boolean;
  errors: ValidationError[];
  warnings: ValidationWarning[];
}

// Example of improved error handling
interface ValidationError {
  code: string;
  message: string;
  location: {
    segment: string;
    field?: string;
    component?: string;
    subcomponent?: string;
  };
  context: string;
}
```
