# HL7v2 Parser

This package is a utility that takes a raw HL7v2 message as input and turns it into an HL7v2 syntax tree following the [@rethinkhealth/hl7v2-ast](../hl7v2-ast/README.md) definition.

This utility is a low level project. Itâ€™s used in [@rethinkhealth/hl7v2](../hl7v2/), which focusses on making it easier to transform content by abstracting these internals away.

## When should I use this?

If you want to handle syntax trees manually, use this. For an easier time processing content, use the [@rethinkhealth/hl7v2](../hl7v2/) ecosystem instead.

## Features

- **Speed-first**: pull-based tokenizer, single pass, minimal object allocations.
- **Spec-aware**: auto-detects delimiters from MSH-1 and MSH-2.
- **AST design**: outputs a unist-compatible tree for use in the HL7v2 unified ecosystem.
- **Composable**: works directly as a unified parser plugin or as a standalone function.
- **Streaming-friendly**: pull-based design is ready for streaming use cases.

## Install 

This package is [ESM only](https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/a39789f98801d908bbc7ff3ecc99d99c). In Node.js (version 16+), install with npm:

```bash
npm install @rethinkhealth/hl7v2-parser
```

## Use

### Basic Usage

```typescript
import { unified } from 'unified';
import { hl7v2Parser } from '@rethinkhealth/hl7v2-parser';

const message = `MSH|^~\\&|SENDING_APP|SENDING_FAC|...`;

const tree = unified()
  .use(hl7v2Parser)
  .parse(message);

console.log(tree);
```

### Custom Delimiters

You can specify custom delimiters for parsing non-standard HL7v2 messages. The `delimiters` option accepts a partial object, so you only need to specify the delimiters you want to override:

```typescript
import { unified } from 'unified';
import { hl7v2Parser } from '@rethinkhealth/hl7v2-parser';

// Override only the segment delimiter
const tree = unified()
  .use(hl7v2Parser, {
    delimiters: {
      segment: '\n', // Use newline instead of carriage return
    }
  })
  .parse(message);

// Override multiple delimiters
const customTree = unified()
  .use(hl7v2Parser, {
    delimiters: {
      field: '$',
      component: '%',
      segment: '\n',
    }
  })
  .parse(customMessage);
```

The default delimiters are:
- `field`: `|`
- `component`: `^`
- `repetition`: `~`
- `subcomponent`: `&`
- `escape`: `\`
- `segment`: `\r`
