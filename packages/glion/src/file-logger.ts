/**
 * Creates a rotating NDJSON file logger for glion's event stream.
 *
 * ## What it writes
 *
 * One JSON object per line (NDJSON) — identical to what `glion start`
 * emits on stdout, so an ingestion tool that reads stdout can read
 * these files without transformation. Each line is the `Event` union
 * from `../events.ts` after encoding.
 *
 * ## Rotation
 *
 * On startup, the log directory is scanned for existing `.ndjson`
 * files. If the count would exceed `cfg.maxFiles` after adding this
 * run's file, the oldest files are deleted until exactly
 * `cfg.maxFiles - 1` remain, then the new file brings the total to
 * `cfg.maxFiles`. Sort order is lexicographic on filename — the
 * ISO-timestamp prefix guarantees this matches chronological order.
 *
 * ## Level filtering
 *
 * Each `Event` has a derived LogLevel (see `levelOf` below). An event
 * passes the filter when its numeric rank is `>=` the configured
 * level. `log` events use their per-event level (the original
 * `console.log` vs `console.warn` distinction) rather than a single
 * lumped-in value.
 *
 * ## Permissions
 *
 * - Dir created with mode 0700 (owner-only)
 * - File created with mode 0600 (owner-only rw)
 *
 * Logs may contain PHI from HL7v2 messages captured via the child's
 * console.log bridge; restricting perms to the owning user is the
 * baseline defense.
 *
 * ## Lifecycle
 *
 * Caller responsibilities: construct with `createFileLogger(opts)`,
 * subscribe `logger.write` to the supervisor's event stream, and
 * `await logger.close()` on shutdown. Late writes after close() are
 * dropped rather than erroring — realistic given signal handlers may
 * race with normal exit paths.
