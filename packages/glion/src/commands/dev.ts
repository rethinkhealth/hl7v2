/**
 * Dev entry — the orchestrator behind `glion dev`.
 *
 * Unlike `runStart` (which is a lean event pipe), dev mode weaves
 * together four subsystems that must cooperate:
 *
 * Config loader → Prebuild → Supervisor → File watcher
 * ↑              │
 * └── rebuild ←──┘
 *
 * The watcher and supervisor form a feedback loop: a file change
 * triggers a rebuild, which produces a fresh manifest, which the
 * supervisor picks up on the next child spawn. The child itself is
 * stateless — it reads the manifest once at startup and never
 * checks for changes.
 *
 * Output is adaptive: TTY gets an interactive TUI (Ink), non-TTY
 * gets JSON lines (same wire format as `glion start`). The branch
 * happens late so all setup work is shared.
