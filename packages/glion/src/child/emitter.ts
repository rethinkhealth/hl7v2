/**
 * Creates the child's event emission function.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * The child process communicates with the parent exclusively through
 * structured JSON events on stdout — one event per line. This is the
 * only IPC channel; there is no reverse path from parent to child.
 *
 * The emitter wraps `stream.write()` with two guarantees:
 *
 * 1. **Non-blocking** — MLLP message handlers must never stall waiting for the
 *    parent to read stdout. If `stream.write()` returns false (kernel pipe
 *    buffer full), events queue in memory and flush when the stream drains.
 * 2. **Bounded memory** — the queue is capped at `maxBuffered`. When full, the
 *    oldest pending event is silently dropped. A `dropped` summary event is
 *    injected before the next successful write so the parent can observe the
 *    loss. This prevents an unresponsive parent from causing the child to OOM.
 *
 * ## Backpressure flow
 *
 *     emit(event)
 *         │
 *         ▼
 *     stamp with ts → encode as JSON line
 *         │
 *         ├─ queue empty & not flushing?
 *         │    └─ flush() → write directly to stream
 *         │         ├─ write returns true  → continue draining queue
 *         │         └─ write returns false → stop, wait for "drain"
 *         │
 *         └─ queue non-empty or flushing?
 *              └─ enqueue(line) → append to FIFO
 *                   └─ queue > maxBuffered? → shift oldest, increment dropped
 *
 * ## Drop recovery
 *
 * When drops have occurred and the queue finally empties (backpressure
 * lifts), the next emit injects a `{ t: "dropped", count: N }` event
 * BEFORE the new event. This tells the parent "you missed N events
 * since the last successful write." The parent's TUI or log aggregator
 * can surface this as a warning.
 *
 * ## Timestamp stamping
 *
 * Each event receives a `ts` field (ISO 8601) at emit time. The
 * caller passes a `PartialEvent` (no `ts` required); the emitter
 * stamps it. If the caller already set `ts` (rare — only in tests),
 * the spread `{ ts: now(), ...partial }` lets the caller's value
 * win because it comes after the default.
 *
 * @param stream - The writable stdout pipe to the parent process.
 * @param options - Buffer size and clock injection for tests.
 * @returns An `emit(event)` function the runner calls for every event.
