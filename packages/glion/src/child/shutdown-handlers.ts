 * 2. Await `server.close()` — stops accepting new connections and
 * waits for in-flight messages to drain.
 * 3. Emit `closed`, then `exit` with code 0 and the signal name.
 * 4. Call exit(0).
 *
 * The `shuttingDown` flag is a latch, not a counter: once the first
 * signal has started the sequence, additional SIGTERM/SIGINT deliveries
 * are silently ignored so a burst of `kill` + `kill` or `SIGTERM + Ctrl-C`
 * cannot double-close the server.
 *
 * If `server.close()` rejects (stuck connection, socket error), we
 * emit an `error` event, still fire `closed` + `exit` so downstream
 * consumers that track the full lifecycle triplet see a complete
 * stream (aggregators, dashboards keying on "every closing has a
 * terminator"), and exit 1. The exit event carries code=1 and the
 * signal name so operators can correlate with what they sent.
