# @rethinkhealth/hl7v2-preset-lint-recommended

**Preset of linting rules for HL7v2**, built on top of the [`unified`][github-unified] ecosystem.  

This preset is meant as a recommended baseline for catching common HL7v2 issues, such as segment structure, field length, and delimiter usage.

## What is this?

This package provides a **recommended set of HL7v2 linting rules**. It ensures a consistent baseline of message quality checks when processing HL7v2 messages with [`unified`][github-unified] and [`@rethinkhealth/hl7v2-parser`][github-hl7v2-parser].

Think of it like ESLintâ€™s "recommended" rules, but for HL7v2.

## When should I use this?

Use this preset if you:

* Want a **sensible default** for linting HL7v2 messages
* Need a **starting point** for building custom HL7v2 lint configurations
* Are using the [`hl7v2-parser`][github-hl7v2-parser] and want to catch common mistakes

It is intended as a **minimum recommended set**. You can extend or override rules in your own configs.

## Install

```sh
npm install @rethinkhealth/hl7v2-preset-lint-recommended
```

## Use

```typescript
import { unified } from 'unified'
import parse from '@rethinkhealth/hl7v2-parser'
import lint from '@rethinkhealth/hl7v2-lint'
import recommended from '@rethinkhealth/hl7v2-preset-lint-recommended'

const file = await unified()
  .use(parse)
  .use(lint)
  .use(recommended)
  .process('MSH|^~\\&|...')
```

## Presets

This preset bundles a set of **recommended HL7v2 linting rules**.  
Each rule has a default severity and may expose configuration options.

| Rule                                                                 | Options         | Default Severity |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|------------------|
| [`hl7v2-lint-segment-header-length`](../hl7v2-lint-segment-header-length) | *none*          | `error`          |


## Security

This plugin only transforms AST nodes and does not execute code. Ensure you trust the source of HL7v2 messages before processing.
