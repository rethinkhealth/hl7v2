## 0.16.0

### Minor Changes

- 5e3d97e: Bump `engines.node` from `>=18` to `>=20` across all `@glion/*` packages.

  Node 18 reaches end-of-life in April 2026; new code in this repo uses
  Node 20+ APIs (notably `AbortSignal.any()` in `@glion/mllp-client`),
  and standardising on a single supported Node line keeps the
  dependency matrix coherent across the monorepo.

  Downstream impact: applications that pin Node 18 will need to upgrade
  to Node 20 or later. Node 20 is itself in active LTS and remains
  supported until April 2026; Node 22 is the current LTS.

## 0.15.0

### Patch Changes

- 5d2e741: Fix DFA runner to match `Hxx` wildcard transitions for site-defined content.
  - Fix `runner()` to fall back to `Hxx` transition when no exact segment match exists
  - Fix effects lookup to use the `Hxx` key on wildcard matches, preventing silent loss of side effects
  - Rename `anyHL7Segment` to `Hxx` in all 99 generated profile automata (v2.3–v2.8.2), aligning with the HAPI convention

- 4af9499: Rename ecosystem from `@rethinkhealth/hl7v2-*` to `@glion/*`. Drop `hl7v2-` prefix from package names (except `@glion/hl7v2`). The `@rethinkhealth/hl7v2-cli` package is removed; its functionality may return as subcommands of `glion` CLI in a future release. Old `@rethinkhealth/*` packages are deprecated with pointers to the new names. No runtime or API changes.

## 0.14.1

### Patch Changes

- @rethinkhealth/hl7v2-utils@0.14.1

## 0.14.0

### Minor Changes

- 3e2c278: Add segment title annotation plugin
  - New package `@rethinkhealth/hl7v2-annotate-profile-segments` — unified plugin that annotates Segment AST nodes with their HL7v2 specification title (e.g., MSH → "Message Header")
  - Add `profiles.segments` store to `@rethinkhealth/hl7v2-profiles` with per-version segment definitions
  - Extend `ProfileContext` with `segments: SegmentDefinition` (breaking — requires updating any code that constructs `ProfileContext` manually)
  - Wire plugin into `@rethinkhealth/hl7v2-preset-annotate-profile-recommended`

### Patch Changes

## 0.13.2

### Patch Changes

- 357e5e3: Remove incorrect `table: "HL70000"` references from field profiles across all HL7v2 versions
  - @rethinkhealth/hl7v2-utils@0.13.2

## 0.13.1

### Patch Changes

- c9fe3ee: Migrate build toolchain from tsup to tsdown
  - Switched JS bundler from tsup (esbuild) to tsdown (Rolldown) across all packages
  - `hl7v2-profiles` now uses Rolldown's `codeSplitting` to merge ~10,800 tiny chunks into ~170 larger ones, significantly improving install and build performance
  - No public API changes — this is a build internals change only

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [575978f]

## 0.12.0

### Minor Changes

- 1ef2a1f: Add `resolveMessageStructure()` utility and remove `hl7v2-lint-message-structure-missing` rule.
  - Add `resolveMessageStructure(version, messageCode, triggerEvent)` to `@rethinkhealth/hl7v2-profiles` for resolving canonical message structure IDs from event maps
  - Resolve message structure from MSH-9.1 + MSH-9.2 via event maps when MSH-9.3 is absent in segment-order linting (wire value wins when present)
  - Remove `hl7v2-lint-message-structure-missing` from `hl7v2-preset-lint-recommended` — it produced false positives for pre-v2.3.1 messages where MSH-9.3 does not exist in the spec

## 0.10.1

### Patch Changes

- cacf65e: Fix field sequence numbers in v2.6–v2.8.2 profiles and re-insert deprecated fields

  The codegen pipeline that generated field profiles for HL7v2 versions v2.6 through v2.8.2 removed deprecated fields from the array and renumbered the remaining fields sequentially. This caused the `sequence` property to represent the array index rather than the HL7 field number, resulting in all annotation and validation applying the wrong metadata to fields in segments with deprecated fields.

  This fix:
  - Corrects `sequence` values on all existing fields to match the HL7 field number (extracted from the `id` property)
  - Re-inserts deprecated fields at their correct sequence positions with `deprecated: true`, sourced from the prior version that last included them
  - Ensures no sequence gaps exist in any segment definition

  127 files across 6 versions (v2.6, v2.7, v2.7.1, v2.8, v2.8.1, v2.8.2) were affected. Versions v2.1 through v2.5.1 were already correct and are unchanged.
