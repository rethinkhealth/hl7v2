### Patch Changes

- e16e519: Add a new `segment-header` node type to the HL7v2 AST ecosystem. This change clarifies segment structure, improves architectural consistency, and enhances the robustness and maintainability of the HL7v2 AST.

## 0.2.19

### Patch Changes

- 04954f1: Refactored the HL7v2 suite to introduce a new architecture for segment nodes. Segment nodes now include a dedicated `name` attribute by default, which explicitly represents the segment header. This enhancement eliminates the previous need to encode the segment header as the first field within the segment's children array. As a result, segment construction and parsing are now more intuitive, and downstream consumers can reliably access segment names via the `name` property rather than inferring them from field data. This change improves type safety, code clarity, and aligns the AST model more closely with HL7v2 semantics.

## 0.2.16

### Patch Changes

- 39d3125: New package that provides a tiny set of helpers for assembling HL7v2 abstract syntax trees and follows the [`@rethinkhealth/hl7v2-ast`](../hl7v2-ast/) schema. The helpers wrap [`unist-builder`](https://github.com/syntax-tree/unist-builder) so you can build trees with a couple of function calls instead of manually nesting nodes.
