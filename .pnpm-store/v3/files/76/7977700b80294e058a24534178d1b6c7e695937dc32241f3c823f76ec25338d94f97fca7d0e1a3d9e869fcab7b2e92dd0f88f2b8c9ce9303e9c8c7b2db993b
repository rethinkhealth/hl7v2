/**
 * Returns an effect that caches its result for a specified `Duration`,

 *
 * **Details**
 *
 * This function is used to cache the result of an effect for a specified amount
 * of time. This means that the first time the effect is evaluated, its result
 * is computed and stored.
 *
 * If the effect is evaluated again within the specified `timeToLive`, the
 * cached result will be used, avoiding recomputation.
 *
 * After the specified duration has passed, the cache expires, and the effect
 * will be recomputed upon the next evaluation.
 *
 * **When to Use**
 *
 * Use this function when you have an effect that involves costly operations or
 * computations, and you want to avoid repeating them within a short time frame.
 *
 * It's ideal for scenarios where the result of an effect doesn't change
 * frequently and can be reused for a specified duration.
 *
 * By caching the result, you can improve efficiency and reduce unnecessary
 * computations, especially in performance-critical applications.
 *
 * **Example**
 *
 * ```ts

 *   console.log("expensive task...")
 *   return new Promise((resolve) => {

 *
 * **Details**
 *
 * This function behaves similarly to {@link cachedWithTTL} by caching the
 * result of an effect for a specified period of time. However, it introduces an
 * additional feature: it provides an effect that allows you to manually
 * invalidate the cached result before it naturally expires.
 *
 * This gives you more control over the cache, allowing you to refresh the
 * result when needed, even if the original cache has not yet expired.
 *
 * Once the cache is invalidated, the next time the effect is evaluated, the
 * result will be recomputed, and the cache will be refreshed.
 *
 * **When to Use**
 *
 * Use this function when you have an effect whose result needs to be cached for
 * a certain period, but you also want the option to refresh the cache manually
 * before the expiration time.
 *
 * This is useful when you need to ensure that the cached data remains valid for
 * a certain period but still want to invalidate it if the underlying data
 * changes or if you want to force a recomputation.

 * Returns a memoized version of a function with effects, reusing results for

 * **Details**
 *
 * This function creates a memoized version of a given function that performs an

 * input, it is stored and reused for subsequent calls with the same input,
 * reducing the need to recompute the result.
 *
 * The function can optionally take an `Equivalence` parameter to
 * determine how inputs are compared for caching purposes.
 *
 * **When to Use**
 *
 * Use this function when you have a function that performs an effect and you

 *
 * It's ideal for functions that produce deterministic results based on their

/**
 * Combines multiple effects into one, returning results based on the input
 * structure.
 *
 * **Details**
 *
 * Use this function when you need to run multiple effects and combine their
 * results into a single output. It supports tuples, iterables, structs, and
 * records, making it flexible for different input types.
 *
 * For instance, if the input is a tuple:
 *
 * ```ts skip-type-checking
 * //         ┌─── a tuple of effects
 * //         ▼
 * Effect.all([effect1, effect2, ...])
 * ```
 *
 * the effects are executed sequentially, and the result is a new effect
 * containing the results as a tuple. The results in the tuple match the order
 * of the effects passed to `Effect.all`.
 *
 * **Concurrency**
 *
 * You can control the execution order (e.g., sequential vs. concurrent) using
 * the `concurrency` option.
 *
 * **Short-Circuiting Behavior**
 *
 * This function stops execution on the first error it encounters, this is
 * called "short-circuiting". If any effect in the collection fails, the
 * remaining effects will not run, and the error will be propagated. To change
 * this behavior, you can use the `mode` option, which allows all effects to run
 * and collect results as `Either` or `Option`.
 *
 * **The `mode` option**
 *
 * The `{ mode: "either" }` option changes the behavior of `Effect.all` to
 * ensure all effects run, even if some fail. Instead of stopping on the first
 * failure, this mode collects both successes and failures, returning an array
 * of `Either` instances where each result is either a `Right` (success) or a
 * `Left` (failure).
 *
 * Similarly, the `{ mode: "validate" }` option uses `Option` to indicate
 * success or failure. Each effect returns `None` for success and `Some` with
 * the error for failure.
 *
 * **Example** (Combining Effects in Tuples)
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Effect, Console } from "effect"
 *
 * const tupleOfEffects = [
 *   Effect.succeed(42).pipe(Effect.tap(Console.log)),
 *   Effect.succeed("Hello").pipe(Effect.tap(Console.log))
 * ] as const
 *
 * //      ┌─── Effect<[number, string], never, never>
 * //      ▼
 * const resultsAsTuple = Effect.all(tupleOfEffects)
 *
 * Effect.runPromise(resultsAsTuple).then(console.log)
 * // Output:
 * // 42
 * // Hello
 * // [ 42, 'Hello' ]
 * ```
 *
 * **Example** (Combining Effects in Iterables)
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Effect, Console } from "effect"
 *
 * const iterableOfEffects: Iterable<Effect.Effect<number>> = [1, 2, 3].map(
 *   (n) => Effect.succeed(n).pipe(Effect.tap(Console.log))
 * )
 *
 * //      ┌─── Effect<number[], never, never>
 * //      ▼
 * const resultsAsArray = Effect.all(iterableOfEffects)
 *
 * Effect.runPromise(resultsAsArray).then(console.log)
 * // Output:
 * // 1
 * // 2
 * // 3
 * // [ 1, 2, 3 ]
 * ```
 *
 * **Example** (Combining Effects in Structs)
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Effect, Console } from "effect"
 *
 * const structOfEffects = {
 *   a: Effect.succeed(42).pipe(Effect.tap(Console.log)),
 *   b: Effect.succeed("Hello").pipe(Effect.tap(Console.log))

 *
 * Effect.runPromise(resultsAsStruct).then(console.log)
 * // Output:
 * // 42
 * // Hello
 * // { a: 42, b: 'Hello' }
 * ```
 *
 * **Example** (Combining Effects in Records)
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Effect, Console } from "effect"
 *
 * const recordOfEffects: Record<string, Effect.Effect<number>> = {
 *   key1: Effect.succeed(1).pipe(Effect.tap(Console.log)),

 * //      ▼
 * const resultsAsRecord = Effect.all(recordOfEffects)
 *
 * Effect.runPromise(resultsAsRecord).then(console.log)
 * // Output:
 * // 1
 * // 2
 * // { key1: 1, key2: 2 }
 * ```
 *
 * **Example** (Short-Circuiting Behavior)
 *
 * ```ts

 * many times, either in sequence or concurrently depending on the provided
 * options.
 *
 * **Options**
 *
 * If the `discard` option is set to `true`, the intermediate results are not
 * collected, and the final result of the operation is `void`.
 *
 * The function also allows you to customize how the effects are handled by
 * specifying options such as concurrency, batching, and how finalizers behave.
 * These options provide flexibility in running the effects concurrently or
 * adjusting other execution details.

 * **Example**
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Console, Effect } from "effect"
 *
 * let counter = 0
 *
 * const task = Effect.sync(() => ++counter).pipe(

 * **Details**

 *
 * Unlike {@link forEach}, which would stop at the first error, this function
 * continues processing all elements, accumulating both successes and failures.
 *
 * **When to Use**
 *
 * Use this function when you want to process every item in a collection, even

 *
 * Keep in mind that if there are any failures, **all successes will be lost**,
 * so this function is not suitable when you need to keep the successful results

/**
 * Creates an `Effect` from a callback-based asynchronous function.
 *
 * **Details**
 *
 * The `resume` function:
 * - Must be called exactly once. Any additional calls will be ignored.
 * - Can return an optional `Effect` that will be run if the `Fiber` executing
 *   this `Effect` is interrupted. This can be useful in scenarios where you
 *   need to handle resource cleanup if the operation is interrupted.
 * - Can receive an `AbortSignal` to handle interruption if needed.
 *
 * The `FiberId` of the fiber that may complete the async callback may also be
 * specified using the `blockingOn` argument. This is called the "blocking
 * fiber" because it suspends the fiber executing the `async` effect (i.e.
 * semantically blocks the fiber from making progress). Specifying this fiber id
 * in cases where it is known will improve diagnostics, but not affect the
 * behavior of the returned effect.
 *
 * **When to Use**
 *
 * Use `Effect.async` when dealing with APIs that use callback-style instead of
 * `async/await` or `Promise`.

 * ```ts
 * import { Effect } from "effect"

 * - **Handling Circular Dependencies**: Useful in managing circular

 * - **Unifying Return Types**: Can help TypeScript unify return types in

 *
 * The function provided to `catchSomeDefect` acts as a filter and a handler for defects:
 * - It receives the defect as an input.
 * - If the defect matches a specific condition (e.g., a certain error type), the function returns

 * manageable errors.
 *
 * **Error Handling**
 *
 * There are two ways to handle errors with `tryPromise`:
 *
 * 1. If you don't provide a `catch` function, the error is caught and the

 * 2. If you provide a `catch` function, the error is caught and the `catch`
 *    function maps it to an error of type `E`.
 *
 * **Interruptions**
 *
 * An optional `AbortSignal` can be provided to allow for interruption of the
 * wrapped `Promise` API.
 *
 * **Example** (Fetching a TODO Item)
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Effect } from "effect"

 * avoid blocking the program due to long-running tasks, especially when those

 * Without `disconnect`, an uninterruptible effect will ignore the

/**
 * Creates a scoped resource using an `acquire` and `release` effect.

 * **Details**
 *
 * This function helps manage resources by combining two `Effect` values: one
 * for acquiring the resource and one for releasing it.
 *
 * `acquireRelease` does the following:
 *
 *   1. Ensures that the effect that acquires the resource will not be
 *      interrupted. Note that acquisition may still fail due to internal
 *      reasons (such as an uncaught exception).
 *   2. Ensures that the `release` effect will not be interrupted, and will be
 *      executed as long as the acquisition effect successfully acquires the
 *      resource.
 *
 * If the `acquire` function succeeds, the `release` function is added to the
 * list of finalizers for the scope. This ensures that the release will happen
 * automatically when the scope is closed.
 *
 * Both `acquire` and `release` run uninterruptibly, meaning they cannot be
 * interrupted while they are executing.
 *
 * Additionally, the `release` function can be influenced by the exit value when
 * the scope closes, allowing for custom handling of how the resource is
 * released based on the execution outcome.

 * **When to Use**

 * This function is used to ensure that an effect that represents the
 * acquisition of a resource (for example, opening a file, launching a thread,
 * etc.) will not be interrupted, and that the resource will always be released
 * when the `Effect` completes execution.
 *
 * **Example** (Defining a Simple Resource)
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Effect } from "effect"
 *
 * // Define an interface for a resource
 * interface MyResource {

 * This function adds a finalizer that will execute whenever the scope of the

 * interrupted. The finalizer receives the `Exit` value of the effect's scope,
 * allowing it to react differently depending on how the effect concludes.
 *
 * Finalizers are a reliable way to manage resource cleanup, ensuring that
 * resources such as file handles, network connections, or database transactions
 * are properly closed even in the event of an unexpected interruption or error.
 *
 * Finalizers operate in conjunction with Effect's scoped resources. If an
 * effect with a finalizer is wrapped in a scope, the finalizer will execute
 * automatically when the scope ends.

/**
 * Forks a fiber in a local scope, ensuring it outlives its parent.
 *
 * **Details**
 *
 * This function is used to create fibers that are tied to a local scope,
 * meaning they are not dependent on their parent fiber's lifecycle. Instead,
 * they will continue running until the scope they were created in is closed.
 * This is particularly useful when you need a fiber to run independently of the
 * parent fiber, but still want it to be terminated when the scope ends.
 *
 * Fibers created with this function are isolated from the parent fiber’s
 * termination, so they can run for a longer period. This behavior is different
 * from fibers created with {@link fork}, which are terminated when the parent fiber
 * terminates. With `forkScoped`, the child fiber will keep running until the
 * local scope ends, regardless of the state of the parent fiber.
 *
 * **Example** (Forking a Fiber in a Local Scope)
 *
 * In this example, the child fiber continues to run beyond the lifetime of the parent fiber.
 * The child fiber is tied to the local scope and will be terminated only when the scope ends.
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Effect, Console, Schedule } from "effect"
 *
 * // Child fiber that logs a message repeatedly every second
 * const child = Effect.repeat(
 *   Console.log("child: still running!"),
 *   Schedule.fixed("1 second")

 * ```
 *
 * **Details**
 *
 * `flatMap` lets you sequence effects so that the result of one effect can be
 * used in the next step. It is similar to `flatMap` used with arrays but works
 * specifically with `Effect` instances, allowing you to avoid deeply nested
 * effect structures.
 *
 * Since effects are immutable, `flatMap` always returns a new effect instead of
 * changing the original one.
 *
 * **When to Use**
 *
 * Use `flatMap` when you need to chain multiple effects, ensuring that each
 * step produces a new `Effect` while flattening any nested effects that may
 * occur.
 *
 * **Example**
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { pipe, Effect } from "effect"
 *
 * // Function to apply a discount safely to a transaction amount
 * const applyDiscount = (
 *   total: number,

 * ```
 *
 * **When to Use**
 *
 * Use `andThen` when you need to run multiple actions in sequence, with the

 * combining effects or handling computations that must happen in order.
 *
 * **Details**
 *
 * The second action can be:

 *
 * If neither effect succeeds, the function will fail with a `Cause`
 * containing all the errors.
 *
 * **When to Use**

 *
 * **Handling Success or Failure with Either**
 *
 * If you want to handle the result of whichever task completes first, whether
 * it succeeds or fails, you can use the `Effect.either` function. This function
 * wraps the result in an `Either` type, allowing you to see if the result
 * was a success (`Right`) or a failure (`Left`).

 * ```ts skip-type-checking
 * let result = initial

 *
 * It starts with an initial state, checks a

 *
 * During each iteration, the `step` function updates the state, and the `body`

 *
 * The results of the body effect can be collected in an array or discarded
 * based on the `discard` option.
 *
 * **Discarding Intermediate Results**
 *
 * - If `discard` is `false` or not provided, the intermediate results are

 * **Details**
 *
 * This function is the foundational way to execute an effect in the background.
 * It creates a "fiber," a lightweight, cooperative thread of execution that can
 * be observed (to access its result), interrupted, or joined. Fibers are useful
 * for concurrent programming and allow effects to run independently of the main
 * program flow.
 *
 * Once the effect is running in a fiber, you can monitor its progress, cancel
 * it if necessary, or retrieve its result when it completes. If the effect
 * fails, the fiber will propagate the failure, which you can observe and
 * handle.
 *
 * **When to Use**
 *
 * Use this function when you need to run an effect in the background,
 * especially if the effect is long-running or performs periodic tasks. It's
 * suitable for tasks that need to run independently but might still need
 * observation or management, like logging, monitoring, or scheduled tasks.
 *
 * This function is ideal if you don't need the result immediately or if the
 * effect is part of a larger concurrent workflow.
 *
 * **Example** (Running an Effect in the Background)
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Effect, Console, Schedule, Fiber } from "effect"
 *
 * //      ┌─── Effect<number, never, never>
 * //      ▼

 * **Details**
 *

 * asynchronous operations. If the effect does fail or involves async tasks, it
 * will throw an error. Execution stops at the point of failure or asynchronous

 * handling.
 *
 * **Important**: Attempting to run effects that involve asynchronous operations
 * or failures will result in exceptions being thrown, so use this function with
 * care for purely synchronous and error-free effects.
 *
 * **When to Use**
 *
 * Use this function when:
 * - You are sure that the effect will not fail or involve asynchronous
 *   operations.
 * - You need a direct, synchronous result from the effect.
 * - You are working within a context where asynchronous effects are not
 *   allowed.
 *
 * Avoid using this function for effects that can fail or require asynchronous
 * handling. For such cases, consider using {@link runPromise} or
 * {@link runSyncExit}.
 *
 * **Example** (Synchronous Logging)
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Effect } from "effect"
 *
 * const program = Effect.sync(() => {

 *   return 1
 * })
 *
 * const result = Effect.runSync(program)
 * // Output: Hello, World!

 * **Example** (Incorrect Usage with Failing or Async Effects)
 *
 * ```ts

 * - If the effect fails, it returns a `Failure` containing a `Cause` that explains

 *
 * If the effect involves asynchronous operations, this function will return a `Failure`

 * - You are working with effects that are purely synchronous and do not involve asynchronous operations.
 * - You need to debug or inspect failures, including their causes, in a detailed manner.
 *
 * Avoid using this function for effects that involve asynchronous operations, as it will fail with a `Die` cause.

 * Safely handles nullable values by creating an effect that fails for `null` or

 *
 * **Details**
 *
 * This function ensures that an input value is non-null and non-undefined
 * before processing it. If the value is valid, the effect succeeds with the
 * value. If the value is `null` or `undefined`, the effect fails with a
 * `NoSuchElementException`. This is particularly useful for avoiding

 * cases where a value is expected but not provided, leading to safer and more
 * predictable code.
 *
 * **When to Use**
 *
 * Use this function when working with values that may be `null` or `undefined`
 * and you want to ensure that only non-null values are processed. It helps
 * enforce null-safety and makes error handling more explicit.

 * **Details**

 * type. If the original effect succeeds, its value is wrapped in `Option.some`.
 * If it fails specifically due to a `NoSuchElementException`, the failure is
 * mapped to `Option.none`. Other types of failures remain unchanged and are
 * passed through as they are.
 *
 * This is useful when working with effects where you want to gracefully handle
 * the absence of a value while preserving other potential failures.

 * **When to Use**
 *

 * rather than throwing or propagating errors like `NoSuchElementException`.
 * It’s ideal for scenarios where you want to explicitly represent optionality
 * in a type-safe way while retaining other failure information.

 * - **Stack traces with location details** if an error occurs.
 * - **Automatic span creation** for tracing when a span name is provided.
 *
 * If a span name is passed as the first argument, the function's execution is

 *
 * - A generator function, allowing the use of `yield*` for effect composition.
 * - A regular function that returns an `Effect`.

 * **Example** (Creating a Traced Function with a Span Name)
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Effect } from "effect"
 *
 * const myfunc = Effect.fn("myspan")(function* <N extends number>(n: N) {
 *   yield* Effect.annotateCurrentSpan("n", n) // Attach metadata to the span
 *   console.log(`got: ${n}`)
 *   yield* Effect.fail(new Error("Boom!")) // Simulate failure
 * })
 *
 * Effect.runFork(myfunc(100).pipe(Effect.catchAllCause(Effect.logError)))
 * // Output:
 * // got: 100
 * // timestamp=... level=ERROR fiber=#0 cause="Error: Boom!
 * //     at <anonymous> (/.../index.ts:6:22) <= Raise location
 * //     at myspan (/.../index.ts:3:23)  <= Definition location
 * //     at myspan (/.../index.ts:9:16)" <= Call location
 * ```
 *
 * `Effect.fn` automatically creates spans. The spans capture information about
 * the function execution, including metadata and error details.
 *
 * **Example** (Exporting Spans to the Console)
 *
 * ```ts skip-type-checking
 * import { Effect } from "effect"
 * import { NodeSdk } from "@effect/opentelemetry"
 * import {
 *   ConsoleSpanExporter,
 *   BatchSpanProcessor
 * } from "@opentelemetry/sdk-trace-base"
 *
 * const myfunc = Effect.fn("myspan")(function* <N extends number>(n: N) {
 *   yield* Effect.annotateCurrentSpan("n", n)
 *   console.log(`got: ${n}`)
 *   yield* Effect.fail(new Error("Boom!"))
 * })
 *
 * const program = myfunc(100)
 *
 * const NodeSdkLive = NodeSdk.layer(() => ({
 *   resource: { serviceName: "example" },
 *   // Export span data to the console
 *   spanProcessor: new BatchSpanProcessor(new ConsoleSpanExporter())
 * }))
 *
 * Effect.runFork(program.pipe(Effect.provide(NodeSdkLive)))
 * // Output:
 * // got: 100
 * // {
 * //   resource: {
 * //     attributes: {
 * //       'service.name': 'example',
 * //       'telemetry.sdk.language': 'nodejs',
 * //       'telemetry.sdk.name': '@effect/opentelemetry',
 * //       'telemetry.sdk.version': '1.30.1'
 * //     }
 * //   },
 * //   instrumentationScope: { name: 'example', version: undefined, schemaUrl: undefined },
 * //   traceId: '22801570119e57a6e2aacda3dec9665b',

 * //   name: 'myspan',
 * //   id: '7af530c1e01bc0cb',
 * //   kind: 0,
 * //   timestamp: 1741182277518402.2,
 * //   duration: 4300.416,
 * //   attributes: {
 * //     n: 100,
 * //     'code.stacktrace': 'at <anonymous> (/.../index.ts:8:23)\n' +
 * //       'at <anonymous> (/.../index.ts:14:17)'
 * //   },
 * //   status: { code: 2, message: 'Boom!' },
 * //   events: [
 * //     {
 * //       name: 'exception',
 * //       attributes: {
 * //         'exception.type': 'Error',
 * //         'exception.message': 'Boom!',
 * //         'exception.stacktrace': 'Error: Boom!\n' +
 * //           '    at <anonymous> (/.../index.ts:11:22)\n' +
 * //           '    at myspan (/.../index.ts:8:23)\n' +
 * //           '    at myspan (/.../index.ts:14:17)'
 * //       },
 * //       time: [ 1741182277, 522702583 ],
 * //       droppedAttributesCount: 0
 * //     }
 * //   ],
 * //   links: []
 * // }
 * ```
 *
 * `Effect.fn` also acts as a pipe function, allowing you to create a pipeline
 * after the function definition using the effect returned by the generator
 * function as the starting value of the pipeline.
 *
 * **Example** (Creating a Traced Function with a Delay)
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Effect } from "effect"
 *
 * const myfunc = Effect.fn(
 *   function* (n: number) {
 *     console.log(`got: ${n}`)
 *     yield* Effect.fail(new Error("Boom!"))
 *   },
 *   // You can access both the created effect and the original arguments
 *   (effect, n) => Effect.delay(effect, `${n / 100} seconds`)
 * )
 *
 * Effect.runFork(myfunc(100).pipe(Effect.catchAllCause(Effect.logError)))
 * // Output:
 * // got: 100
 * // timestamp=... level=ERROR fiber=#0 cause="Error: Boom! (<= after 1 second)
 * ```
 *
 * @see {@link fnUntraced} for a version of this function that doesn't add a span.
