# @rethinkhealth/qa

Healthcare-grade QA verification for the `@rethinkhealth/hl7v2-*` parser pipeline.

This workspace tests the distributed product as a consumer would — importing packages via `workspace:*` and verifying correctness, resilience, and performance across the full plugin chain.

## Quality Layers

| Test Suite  | File                        | What it verifies                                                  |
| ----------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Conformance | `tests/conformance.test.ts` | Golden-file snapshots for all common message types and edge cases |
| Diagnostics | `tests/diagnostics.test.ts` | Exact diagnostic output for known violations (truth-table style)  |
| Fuzz        | `tests/fuzz.test.ts`        | Parser never throws on arbitrary input (property-based)           |
| Round-trip  | `tests/round-trip.test.ts`  | `parse(S) → serialize = S` for valid messages                     |
| Performance | `tests/performance.test.ts` | Hard time thresholds at hospital-scale message volumes            |

## Running

```bash
# From the repo root (recommended — turbo handles build ordering):
pnpm test

# From this directory (requires packages to be built first):
pnpm test
```

Packages must be built before QA tests can run. Running `pnpm test` from the repo root handles this automatically via turbo's `"dependsOn": ["^build"]` chain. If running directly inside `qa/`, build first with `pnpm build` from the root.

## Adding Fixtures

Drop a `.hl7` file into `qa/fixtures/` — the conformance test auto-discovers it. Use these naming conventions:

- `adt-a01-*.hl7`, `oru-r01-*.hl7`, etc. — conformance corpus (valid messages)
- `edge-*.hl7` — boundary condition messages
- `invalid-*.hl7` — messages with intentional violations (consumed by diagnostics tests)

## Arbitraries

`src/arbitraries.ts` provides `fast-check` generators for property-based tests:

- `arbHL7v2Message` — structurally valid messages with default delimiters
- `arbHL7v2MessageCustomDelimiters` — valid messages with randomized delimiter sets
- `arbMutatedMessage` — valid messages with random corruption
- `arbAdversarialInput` — Unicode, null bytes, delimiter-only strings, long payloads
