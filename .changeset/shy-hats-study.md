"@rethinkhealth/hl7v2-builder": patch
---

New package that provides a tiny set of helpers for assembling HL7v2 abstract syntax trees and follows the [`@rethinkhealth/hl7v2-ast`](../hl7v2-ast/) schema. The helpers wrap [`unist-builder`](https://github.com/syntax-tree/unist-builder) so you can build trees with a couple of function calls instead of manually nesting nodes.
