Introduce `@rethinkhealth/hl7v2-decode-escapes`, a new package for decoding HL7v2 escape sequences. HL7v2 messages use escape sequences to represent reserved separator characters and special symbols within data fields. This package provides utilities to accurately decode these sequences, ensuring correct parsing and interpretation of HL7v2 message content.
