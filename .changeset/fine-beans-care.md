"@rethinkhealth/hl7v2-util-semver": patch
---

Introduce a minimal, dependency-free utility for handling HL7v2 version strings inspired by semver, supporting basic comparisons (`=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`) and whitespace-separated AND-only ranges. The utility provides functions to parse, clean, compare, validate, and test version satisfaction for major[.minor][.patch] formats, ensuring fast and standards-aligned HL7v2 version operations.
