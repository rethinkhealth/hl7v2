"@rethinkhealth/hl7v2-report": patch
---

Added a new package `@rethinkhealth/hl7v2-report` to provide tools for generating standardized, type-safe, and accessible diagnostics from [HL7v2 ASTs](https://github.com/rethinkhealth/hl7v2). It is designed to be fast, robust, and easily integratable with `vfile`.
