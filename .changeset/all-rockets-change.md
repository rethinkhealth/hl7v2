"@rethinkhealth/hl7v2-ast": patch

Updated the HL7v2 AST definition and its documentation to more closely follow unist guidelines, clarify node hierarchy, and provide a more structured and lossless representation of HL7v2 messages. This includes clearer definitions for node types, hierarchy, and value handling.
