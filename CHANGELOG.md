# @rethinkhealth/hl7v2

## 0.0.11

### Patch Changes

- 8693087: fixed an error with duplicate definitions in the schema of the HL7v2 messages.

## 0.0.10

### Patch Changes

- 7f05b54: Added support to Fields schema definition.
- b8c84d9: Added support to `chapter`. HL7v2 is organized into chapters, each of which covers a different aspect of the messaging standard. The chapters describe the various message types, the segments that make up those messages, and the data types used within those segments.
- f07876d: Added support to Message Structure standard table. This helps retrieving the appropriate schema for most messages using the mapping in the standard table. For instance, ADT A04 does not have a defined schema. However, it has the exact definition of ADT A01. That mapping is available through the [standard table](https://terminology.hl7.org/5.1.0/CodeSystem-v2-0354.json.html).

## 0.0.9

### Patch Changes

- 09b8339:
  - Adding Message Structure to the header.
  - Replaced the JSON Schema retrieval to use the Message Structure of the header segment.
- b2e36de: Added `metadata` to each segment in the definition of messages. Metadata includes information about `minOccurs`, `maxOccurs`, `repeatability`, and `optionality`.
- 073f588: Added compatibility with Z segment

## 0.0.8

### Patch Changes

- 8837127: We added browser compatiblity of the package. The package can now be used in the browser.

  <script>
    const hl7v2 = window.hl7v2;

  </script>
  ```

## 0.0.6

### Patch Changes

- 04b6c9b: Update `tsup` configuration and bundling options. The bundle now includes the `hl7v2` schema for `2.8` and `2.5.1`. You can now import the schema directly from the package:

  ```ts
  import { v2_8 } from "@rethinkhealth/hl7v2/schema";

  const siu_s12_schema = v2_8.SIU_S12;

  // ... can be  used to validate a message using json-schema
  ```
